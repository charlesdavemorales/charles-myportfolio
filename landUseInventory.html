<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p style="box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(1, 1, 1, 1);">In a world where urbanization and land use are of paramount importance, the development
 of a comprehensive Land Use Inventory system is crucial. This project delves into the design
 and implementation of a Land Use Inventory system using the C programming language. The system
 allows you to add lots, search lots, examine lists of lots you've input, and display a graphictal
 representation of the lot.</p>
<p
style="box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(1, 1, 1, 1);">The Land Use Inventory Program is a comprehensive system developed in C programming language. 
System is designed to manage land use data by allowing users to add, search, and view lots with
 their respective coordinates and calculate the area of each lot. This document provides a detailed
 explanation of the program’s structure, functionality, and usage.</p>
<p style="box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(1, 1, 1, 1);">The design of the system is user-friendly, including options such as "1. Add lot, 2. Search lot, 
 3. View lots, and 4. Exit." Each action is accompanied with a question that interacts with the user.
 A seamless and intuitive experience is ensured by this iterative quick design.</p>
<p style="box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(1, 1, 1, 1);">To ensure the accuracy and reliability of data, the system verifies the land use categories before
 processing a query. If data is inconsistent, a prompt informs the user, preventing inaccurate analysis 
 and misinformation.</p>
<p style="box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(1, 1, 1, 1);">The system incorporates an efficient spatial analysis mechanism. Users are prompted to select a specific 
area, and the program calculates the land area using the shoelace formula.</p>
<p style="box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(1, 1, 1, 1);">After the analysis, the system verifies the results, ensuring that the land use data is accurate and reliable.
 If successful, the results are added to the system's database, while inconsistencies prompt the system to recheck 
 the data.<p>
<p style="box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(1, 1, 1, 1);">This project introduces a comprehensive Land Use Inventory system, striving to achieve a balance between user 
satisfaction, data accuracy, and efficient land use management. Utilizing the capabilities of the C programming 
language, this system aims to contribute to the evolving landscape of urban planning and sustainable development.</p>

<h2> Scope and Limitations </h2>
<p style="box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(1, 1, 1, 1);">The goal of the Land Use Inventory System is to give users an adaptive and easy to use tool for tracking land lots.
 This project encompasses functionalities such as managing lots, presenting visual representation through a graphics 
 library, enabling search operations, performing area calculations and an intuitive interface. The users are tree to
 search lots, add lots, and view lots with their variable coordinates, description and lot names. The graphical representation
 can help to the user to visualize the shape of the lot. This project enables to the user to enter the lot names or search. View 
 the lots and visualize the shape of the lot. Also, this project views the total lots you have. The project aims to redefine how 
 users interact with and understand their land data.</p>
	<p style="box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(1, 1, 1, 1);">The Land Use Inventory System demonstrate its functionalities, it is essential to acknowledge certain limitations. 
	The system prioritizes essential land use inventory activities but might lack some of the advanced features seen in more 
	comprehensive land management systems. Its use of a specific graphics library tailored for Turbo C could potentially pose 
	functionality issues in today’s development setting. While the system effectively manages files, it doesn’t include advance
	features like versioning or automatic backups, keeping it straightforward in ensuring data durability. There’s a chance to
	make it more use-friendly by in cooperating these features and enhancing the codes reliability in managing information. The 
	way the program organizes data, using arrays for coordinates, puts a limit on the number of dots a lot can include. It’s like
	having a set structure for arranging information, but this means there’s a cap of the complexity of each lot.</p>
