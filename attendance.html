            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Attendance needs to be managed with speed and accuracy for any school function to be completed successfully. Keeping this in mind, we have developed our Online Attendance System with demanding features for educational institutions to build a fully-fledged attendance management system for every school activity. It includes photo compulsory verification and precise geolocation tracking. At check-in, a picture is required to be uploaded by the students and the instructors. This ensures that the attendance recorded will only be of those physically present at the event venue. Accurate attendance records are the result of this dual layer of verification, and it also improves security by minimizing fraudulent entries. Administrators and event organizers have total control over all aspects of attendance data. Furthermore, viewing, managing, and printing detailed attendance lists becomes an easy task, thereby simplifying record-keeping and report generation. This modern and user-friendly platform enables schools to efficiently manage assemblies, field trips, and extracurricular activities, ensuring reliable and readily accessible attendance records.</p>
            <p>Now, educational institutions can embrace the future of attendance management through our innovative system that addresses the fast-changing needs of educational institutions.</p>

        <section id="scope" class="scope">
            <h2>Scope and Limitation</h2>
            <h3>Scope</h3>
            <p>Campus Event Management is a comprehensive web application designed to facilitate the organization and management of campus events. The application is divided into two main modules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>UB-ADMIN:</strong> This is the primary administrative interface of the web application. Administrators have privileges to edit or delete user accounts, admin accounts, and event setups. Only verified students can be viewed. The module allows for the addition of new admin accounts.</li>
                <li><strong>UB-EVENT:</strong> This module serves both admin and user (student) roles. Admins or school officers organizing events can post events, set desired time frames, locations, and radius limits. Admins can collect student attendance after the event is officially concluded. Students can attend events once their accounts are verified, and they must upload a picture as proof of attendance.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Facial Recognition:</strong> The web application currently lacks automatic facial recognition capabilities. As a result, users may potentially upload fake pictures as proof of attendance. Admins are unable to verify user identities due to the absence of facial recognition security.</li>
                <li><strong>Internet Connectivity:</strong> The Campus Event Management web application requires an active internet connection to function. Users and admins without internet access cannot use the web application and must attend events physically at the designated stamping area.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section id="problem" class="problem">
            <h2>Problem Requirements</h2>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>Special attention deserves the definition of our Online Attendance System’s goal: to transform traditional attendance recording and control in educational institutions and the verification of students’ attendance at school activities. In the traditional tracking of attendance, several factors are experienced that include the following: the processes are demanding and are easily susceptible to fraud. Our system deals with these difficulties through a smart approach of providing an online platform that guarantees reliability, safety, and effectiveness.</p>
            <p>This method’s combination of photo verification and geographical location tracking eliminates both the risk of fake attendance and imprecise location identification. Unlike other popular event checking applications, students and instructors must be physically present at the event location and take a real photo which is quite effective in reducing fake event check-ins. This also ensures the validity of attendance records while at the same time improving standards of safety and responsibility of occasions held in schools.</p>
            <p>In addition, it also provides functional and effective tools to the administrator; where they can manage and monitor attendance of their subordinates and also generate report easily. The functionality for creating and generating comprehensible attendance lists is also helpful in better surveillance and easy work in general. The Online Attendance System is finally aimed at meeting schools’ operational requirements helping schools manage their events and arrange other aspects of school’s life more effectively.</p>

            <h2>Overall Description</h2>
            <h3>Purpose and Scope</h3>
            <p>The Campus Event Management system is a meticulously designed web-based application aimed at simplifying the organization and participation in campus events. It streamlines administrative tasks and enhances user experience, offering a comprehensive solution for event organizers and participants.</p>
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>The documentation targets developers, administrators, and end-users involved in campus event management within educational institutions.</p>
            <h3>System Architecture</h3>
            <p>The system comprises two main modules, UB-ADMIN and UB-EVENT, each catering to different user needs. UB-ADMIN serves as the administrative hub, while UB-EVENT facilitates event posting, attendance tracking, and participant interaction.</p>
            <h3>Libraries and Backend Technologies</h3>
            <p>The system is developed using Java as the backend technology, leveraging libraries such as Servlets, JSP (JavaServer Pages), and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for server-side processing and database interactions.</p>
            <h3>Platform Compatibility</h3>
            <p>The system is designed to run on Java EE 9 application servers, such as Apache Tomcat, and can be deployed on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>
            <h3>Constraints and Assumptions</h3>
            <p>Developers should consider performance limitations based on server infrastructure and the number of concurrent users. Compatibility with older web browsers may be limited due to the use of modern web technologies.</p>
            <h3>Security Considerations</h3>
            <p>The system employs authentication mechanisms to ensure only verified users can access administrative features and attendance for events.</p>
            <h3>Performance Characteristics</h3>
            <p>The system aims to deliver fast response times and efficient resource utilization within the constraints of the Java EE environment and server specifications.</p>

            <h3>Files and Their Descriptions</h3>
            <p>By using JavaServer Pages (JSP), we can combine both the back-end and front-end in a single file. This approach simplifies debugging since you can easily locate errors within the JSP file. However, this may compromise code cleanliness, making it less maintainable in the long run.</p>
