        <h1>Polynomial Intersection Finder</h1>
        <p>
            The <strong>Polynomial Intersection Finder</strong> is a web application designed to provide information interactively by accepting numerical inputs from users. It plots values on a graph based on user inputs, focusing on the intersection of polynomials and their graphical relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project also includes quadratic equations since their relationship with polynomial intersections relates to graph intersections. It demonstrates how curves or points are positioned on the Cartesian plane based on user-provided values. The tool helps users understand, manipulate, and apply the quadratic formula by completing procedures and plotting them on the graph. It addresses problems such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>No root or one root</li>
            <li>Two roots</li>
            <li>General plotting values for graphs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Most educational curricula involve techniques like factorization, the square root method, completing the square, and the quadratic formula. Each method has its pros and cons for teaching and learning. This project focuses on students and teachers who wish to expand their knowledge of polynomial intersections and quadratic equations. The <strong>Polynomial Intersection Finder</strong> aids in solving math problems by automatically graphing based on user input and explaining results.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Graphing polynomial intersections and quadratic equations based on user inputs</li>
            <li>Automatic detection and explanation of intersection points or lack thereof</li>
            <li>Support for saving graphs as files, with customizable file names</li>
            <li>Accessible via any internet browser</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            The Polynomial Intersection Finder emphasizes solving or finding the value of <em>x</em>. While quadratic equations and polynomial intersections differ—quadratic equations deal with coefficient values, and polynomial intersections involve constants and finding intersections—they share similarities in the use of coefficient values. This web application leverages these similarities to create graphs automatically based on user input, offering a practical learning and teaching tool for students and educators alike.
